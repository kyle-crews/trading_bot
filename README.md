Run algorithmic trading strategies on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the Alpaca API. For demo/testing purposes, I will be using a momentum strategy that looks for the stocks over the past 125 days with the most momentum and trades every day.

**NOTICE**

You **SHOULD NOT** blindly use this strategy without backtesting it thoroughly. I really canâ€™t stress that enough. This is not intended as a recommendation or financial advice. You **SHOULD NOT** take investment advice from me, you will most likely be sorry ðŸ˜„.
